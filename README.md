# Triad
A toy operating system written in Rust.

## The Philosophy: Why "Triad"?

The name pays homage to *[Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)* (OSTEP), a foundational book on operating systems, which concentrates on three fundamental concepts - 

1.  **Virtualization:** (CPU, Memory)
2.  **Concurrency:** (Threads, Locks, Synchronization)
3.  **Persistence:** (File Systems, I/O)
